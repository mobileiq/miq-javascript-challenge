## Mobile IQ JavaScript Interview Challenge

This is your chance to show us just how much you know JavaScript. Our philosophy is framework-agnostic, and we believe good JavaScript programmers know JavaScript.

This shouldn't take more than a couple of hours to complete, so get some coffee on.

### The goal

To demonstrate a grasp of a reasonably broad range of JavaScript's core concepts and patterns.

### The Test

We have provided a [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine) test suite with a series of stub implementations. Of course, these stub implementations are currently empty and all of the tests fail as a result.

The challenge is to fill in the implementations such that all of the tests pass.

### Running the test suite

Simply point a browser to the `index.html`.

### Getting the test to us

Although we normally follow a streamlined flow based on pull requests, that isn't the best way forward here â€“ you wouldn't want other candidates seeing your great code.

Just zip up the test, or just send the `test.js` back to us and we'll take a look.

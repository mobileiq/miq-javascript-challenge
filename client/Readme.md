# Table Football Scores

##Intro
Here at Mobile IQ, we love playing table football. We're so competetive we thought it'd be a great idea to record the
scores on a webapp. However, we've not had a chance to finish completing the app. We love backbone, so it was a natural
choice to use it here.

We expect the task to take no longer than an hour to get working to a resonable standard, we're not too judgemental on
UI, it's the code we care about.

##Getting setup
In order to run the app, you'll need to extract the entire directory onto a local HTTP server, it's bootstrapped with
some json files it needs to load over http.

##Getting it working
* It'll need someway to add a results / players, don't worry about persisting these beyond the browser session
* It'd be great if you get edit results/players
* You can easily see who's won a match because you highlight the player name, that rocks.
* Even better if you could save the results into the browsers localStorage.
